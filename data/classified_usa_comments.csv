36,Don't know,Don't know,No,No,Large,No,Never,I'm not on my company's health insurance which could be part of the reason I answered Don't know to so many questions.,Unclassified,14
29,Yes,Somewhat easy,No,No,Medium,No,Rarely,I have chronic low-level neurological issues that have mental health side effects. One of my supervisors has also experienced similar neurological problems so I feel more comfortable being open about my issues than I would with someone without that experience.,Both,16

35,Yes,Very easy,Yes,No,Mega,No,Sometimes,Sometimes I think  about using drugs for my mental health issues. If i use drugs I feel better,Both,26
42,Yes,Very easy,Maybe,No,Medium,Yes,Sometimes,I selected my current employer based on its policies about self care and the quality of their overall health and wellness benefits. I still have residual caution from previous employers who ranged from ambivalent to indifferent to actively hostile regarding mental health concerns.,Both,34
38,Yes,Somewhat easy,No,No,Medium,No,Sometimes,Our health plan has covered my psychotherapy and my antidepressant medication. My manager has been aware but discreet throughout. I did get negative reviews when my depression was trashing my delivery but y'know I wasn't delivering.,Depression,46
30,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Medium,No,Rarely,I just started a new job last week hence a lot of don't know's,Unclassified,50
35,Don't know,Somewhat easy,No,No,Medium,Yes,Sometimes,I've seen negative consequences towards mental health conditions in previous workplaces.Working remote is empowering in this way.,Both,107
30,Don't know,Don't know,Maybe,Maybe,Mega,Yes,,I'd be more worried about coworkers and workplace culture than the employer--they're probably legally obligated to do some things but reputation among people I work with is something else. For instance I've heard people make snide remarks about men taking paternity leave I don't want to know what they'd say about mental health leave.,Both,145
27,No,Somewhat difficult,Maybe,No,Medium,Yes,Rarely,Had a co-worker disappear from work for a few weeks and then come back to let everyone know he was bipolar. His responsibilities and schedule were adjusted to accommodate but he got worse didn't show up didn't work etc and was eventually let go.It was tough because on the one hand he was struggling with some mental health issues but on the other hand he went through a period of months where he wasn't performing.,Both,159
25,Don't know,Very easy,Maybe,No,Medium,No,Sometimes,Family history of depression.  Currently dealing with depression and anxiety as well as drug addition.Employer provides & pays premiums on insurance which covers therapy and prescriptions.  Employer allows work-from-home and unlimited PTO which makes episodes easier to control.I don't speak of my problems to anyone at work except for the people that I consider friends and even then I don't go into great detail.I would never bring up a mental health issue during an interview for fear of discrimination and rejection (and therefore greater depression).  One co-worker had serious anxiety problems and would not inform his team of episodes and was eventually let go for being unresponsive.,Both,160
33,No,Very difficult,No,No,Small,No,Sometimes,Many of these questions become irrelevant once 'Yes' is selected for 'Are you self-employed'.  It would be preferable for there to be a 'Not Relevant' option on these.,Unclassified,165
32,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Small,Yes,Often,I am not sure about my company's healthcare because I've opted out of it and I'm covered under another policy.I currently work at a great company though in past jobs I don't think I would have felt comfortable talking about mental health at all.,Both,178
45,Yes,Somewhat difficult,No,No,Small,No,Sometimes,In small startups it is very hard to keep mental health issues truly private no matter what management does.,Both,179
33,Don't know,Very easy,No,No,Small,Yes,,A close family member of mine struggles with mental health so I try not to stigmatize it. My employers/coworkers also seem compassionate toward any kind of health or family needs.,Both,180
27,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Medium,No,Sometimes,My seniority at the company and rapport with the owners has helped me gain support for seeking help regarding my mental health as well as being able to take time off or work from home when an episode starts.However I don't feel that the company's stance on mental health is as clear as say something like vision or dental.  There's very much a stigma.,Both,201
27,No,Very difficult,No,No,Small,Yes,Sometimes,Many of these questions were difficult to answer as a self-employed person; I did my best with the available options.,Unclassified,216
34,Yes,Somewhat easy,No,No,Small,No,,One of my coworkers has mental health issues and she's open about them (eg: my enjoyment of this project may be due to my recent change in meds). I believe the response has been generally supportive. We're a very small tight-knit company.,Both,221

41,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,Maybe,Large,Yes,Rarely,I found it difficult to answer all of the questions effectively as many of them would depend on the nature of the mental health issues as some seem more socially accepted than others. For some people telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling. They might both be bits of irrelevant information (past behavior and not indicators of future behavior). However western culture pushes us to appear as capable as possible to our supervisors in pursuit of excellence in our work. Providing information that could create a negative bias seems like a more genuine and yet more risky approach to the discussion.,Both,232
40,Yes,Don't know,Yes,Maybe,Mega,Yes,Sometimes,I have only discussed my mental illness with close family members. I feel completely uncomfortable discussing with anyone at my place of employment as I am concerned it would have negative consequences.,Unclassified,246
42,No,Somewhat easy,No,No,Small,Yes,Never,No benefits at this organization but my employer/direct supervisor has had positive and constructive conversations with me about physical and mental health. Supervisor offered solutions advice time/energy to get help if I ever felt that needed it. (though it would have to be at my own expense). I feel safe sharing personal info with this particular person/company but this environment is the exception rather than the norm in my 15+ years as a tech worker. I would never feel safe enough to reveal info about any mental health concerns with any previous employers in the tech industry for fear of  negative perceptions job loss performance dings etc. ,Both,258
41,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Medium,Yes,Sometimes,I think I am very lucky in my workplace. Our CEO has a degree in psychology.,Unclassified,267

27,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,No,Sometimes,The thought of going through my employer directly to get help is fucking scary.Getting help is the hardest part of getting help.,Unclassified,310
27,Don't know,Very easy,No,No,Mega,No,,Don't know because I haven't checked not because it's difficult to find out. If you didn't have the don't know option I would've looked up the answer.,Unclassified,315
24,Yes,Don't know,Yes,No,Mega,No,,I think there might be some bugs in my thought but I haven't sought treatment because they're not worse than annoying and I worry about having the label.,Unclassified,339
29,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Medium,No,,I think a lot of our policy is based on a situation that occurred in the past 5 years. A very public mental illness happened with a coworker that unfortunately ended negatively. It was definitely a catalyst to talking about our options but the overall sentiment of it being OK to take time off talk with your supervisors etc. has always been there. It's a great company.,Unclassified,340
27,Don't know,Very easy,Yes,No,Mega,No,Sometimes,Regardless of a stated lack of negative consequences for discussing mental health issues with coworkers/superiors unconscious bias is a very real thing - as long as I don't *need* to inform my co-workers my mental health issues do not need to be public knowledge.,Both,343
23,Don't know,Don't know,No,No,Large,No,Sometimes,YOU MAY WANT TO THROW OUT MY ENTRY.I answered all of these questions with the assumption that Attention Deficit Disorder is considered a mental illness and with ADD in mind.,Unclassified,347

32,Yes,Somewhat easy,Maybe,No,Medium,No,Sometimes,My employer does what they can providing a wellness program and pointing it out after particularly stressful times. But the interaction between the wellness program and the medical insurance is unpleasant and finding a long-term therapist / psychiatrist covered by insurance is amazingly difficult. My current lack of active treatment is due to insurance friction more than workplace friction.,Anxiety,374
34,Yes,Very difficult,Maybe,Maybe,Mega,No,Rarely,I work for a university.,Unclassified,379
35,Yes,Very difficult,Maybe,Maybe,Large,No,Sometimes,I'm troubled by the way that our hiring process tends to filter out non-neurotypicals of all stripes. Competent people who act a little funny can be hard to hire.,Unclassified,404
27,Don't know,Somewhat difficult,Maybe,Maybe,Medium,No,Sometimes,I talked to a psychiatrist once about taking medical leave for mental health issues with his referral. He was willing to help but warned me that I may not want to as he's seen that sort of thing follow people throughout their tech careers (word gets out even if it's confidential at work). I've been terrified of bringing mental health up anywhere that coworkers or potential employers could see ever since.,Both,435
43,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Small,Yes,Often,So much depends upon the organization. ,Unclassified,451
34,Don't know,Don't know,Yes,Yes,Small,No,Sometimes,Now at starutp.  Previously worked at big tech company which was actually quite good at supporting mental health issues.  Still wouldn't share with bosses/other employees though as there remains a strong negative stigma.,Both,454
33,Yes,Very easy,Maybe,No,Large,No,Never,I currently have the best managers I've ever worked with. I don't have any issues but one of my coworkers recently did and it was handled extremely well. ,Unclassified,462
36,Yes,Somewhat difficult,Yes,Maybe,Mega,No,Sometimes,Stigma is the worst. People first language is a small step but we can't get that right.,Unclassified,497
39,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Medium,No,Never,I work for an extremely supportive company and we are amazingly open about mental health issues. Employees often share their struggles with the whole team and receive a high level of support in return.,Both,514
25,Don't know,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,No,,I'm not aware of anyone with mental health issues at work it's definitely not something that's discussed publicly. There's also a lot of other personal info I don't know about my coworkers so it may just be that we tend not to talk about personal issues.,Both,551
33,Don't know,Don't know,Yes,No,Medium,No,,I'm afraid I haven't seen mental health issues arise at work yet. They are very accommodating with maternity leave but I don't know how that translates to anything else.,Both,558

34,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Medium,Yes,Sometimes,Thanks for doing this. It will help end the stigma!,Unclassified,580
29,Don't know,Somewhat difficult,Yes,No,Medium,No,Sometimes,It has come to interfere with work as life progresses.Between burn out and enduring more of the work and balancing a family. Changes in my mental health have a larger pond to make ripples in.,Both,592
35,No,Very easy,No,No,Small,Yes,,The supposed divide between mental and physical health needs to done away with and probably will be as our knowledge of the brain increases. That said we are often employed for our ability to provide value. If any issue prevents is from providing value that creates a very real challenge for the employer who is responsible to shareholders and other team members who are providing value. There are no easy answers here.,Unclassified,602
30,No,Somewhat difficult,No,No,Small,Yes,Often,Because I'm self-employed and the only person in my organization I would have liked a not applicable option. I don't want my answers to be misleading.,Unclassified,604
50,Don't know,Don't know,Yes,Maybe,Small,Yes,Sometimes,I work for a very small firm that doesn't really have a dedicated H/R person. Also for the question:If you have a mental health condition do you feel that it interferes with your work?...I don't have a diagnosed mental health condition but I suspect I might have some slight depression issues. Definitely have Imposter Syndrome.,Depression,607
32,No,Somewhat easy,No,No,Small,No,Sometimes,I went through a divorce and was pretty depressed I went to therapy and my boss (one of the owners) was extremely supportive. I'm not sure I would have got through that rough time with out my co-workers and boss.,Depression,611
35,Yes,Very difficult,Yes,No,Large,Yes,Rarely,I'm diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. My benefits for mental health exist but are terrible. The deductible is $800. I see a therapist once or twice a month at the cost of $150. The insurance company only values it at $40. My psychiatrist is $180 for 15 minutes. The insurance company values it at $80. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hit my deductible. I don't even bother making the claims.,Both,618
34,No,Somewhat easy,No,No,Small,No,Sometimes,thanks for what you're doing. FYI these questions dont quite work for entrepreneurs where employer == cofounders / sr mgmt / me,Unclassified,628
39,Don't know,Don't know,No,No,Mega,Yes,Rarely,I mostly suffer from social anxiety which keeps me from attending conferences. In my small dev group a big problem is a supervisor who's a workaholic and will never say no when asked to do something so he's doing the job of at least two ppl (poorly) and working crazy hours setting the tone for the test of us that work/life balance isn't important.,Anxiety,651
5,Don't know,Somewhat easy,No,No,Large,No,,We had a developer suffer from depression and pretty hard burnout but he refused treatment even when the company said we'd foot the bill. Eventually he had to be asked to resign which was a shame. I don't know if we have any specific programs for mental health but we're definitely on the lookout for those types of issues.,Depression,735
36,Yes,Very difficult,Maybe,Maybe,Large,Yes,Sometimes,I am a 15 year vet of the industry and I get 2 weeks of combined sick and vacation time a year and I have children to fit into that too. I've had heart problems from the stress. Fuck everything about startup culture. ,Anxiety,745
35,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Small,No,Rarely,Since I am the CEO of my startup some of the would you feel comfortable and do you know the policy questions are interesting.  Of course I feel comfortable since no one can fire me and I know the policies because I chose them!However now I am curious if my employees know just how supportive the company would be of their mental health needs and this survey is making me realize that we probably haven't done a great job communicating that to everyone.  Thanks for doing this.,Both,749
38,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Medium,No,Sometimes,I work for the state so the health plan is large and cumbersome.  I believe it covers most medical as a state benefit but I haven't seen any promotion of it.  And it's not really the same as a tech company where I am.  We are an IT department but hardly run like any tech company around.,Unclassified,757
21,No,Don't know,Yes,No,Mega,No,Often,I have Narcolepsy and have been fired from a job before for falling asleep standing up during a meeting. I was standing up in the back of the room so that i could pace and try to prevent myself from falling asleep. I still managed to fall asleep while standing and fell over against the wall. I was fired the next day. The worst part is this is a condition i had given months of notice about to my boss and i reminded her of it before the meeting. I worked at a hospital at the time. I would have thought that they would be more accommodating.,Unclassified,760
33,No,Very easy,Maybe,Maybe,Small,Yes,Sometimes,My current work situation was constructed in part because of my mental health issues. One of the reasons I'm self employed is to give me the most flexibility for coping with my mental health issues.I have been removed from a client project in the past because of a mental health condition. This was while I was an employee for a large consulting company. ,Both,772
35,Yes,Very difficult,Yes,Maybe,Large,No,Sometimes,I work for the state government. While things are slowly changing regarding covering mental health with state employees it's just not something that is acceptable in this kind of strict environment so I have to be careful about what I say and how I say it. I often take mental health days but have to call in with a physical illness because mental health problems are not acceptable excuses for using sick leave.,Both,794
35,Don't know,Very easy,Maybe,No,Large,Yes,Sometimes,It might be safe to talk about it where I am now but I don't know for sure and I err on the side of being over cautious. Struggle with depression and anxiety which sometimes affects my productivity but I try to make up / cover up for it instead of being open about it.,Both,800
40,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,No,Sometimes,I'm comfortable talking about mental health with my current supervisor & my immediate at my current job but this is a first for me!,Both,807
48,Don't know,Very difficult,Yes,Yes,Medium,No,Often,None of us who are already in marginal groups in tech--the non-young the non-male the non-white--will risk our careers to admit another source of stigma: poor health.,Unclassified,826
31,Yes,Somewhat difficult,No,No,Large,No,Sometimes,I have been incredibly public about my own struggle in my own conversations and in social media insofar as how I can use my depression to raise awareness or help others. Because of that my employer - or any future employer - kind of knows by default. It's not a secret. That said the downside of that openness is that I have no faith that I wouldn't be discriminated against at a future job simply because the information is public. Likewise I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless I don't regret being public and raising awareness. My point is that even those of us who do publicly discuss the issue fear systemic retribution. ,Depression,843
34,Don't know,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,No,Sometimes,At a previous employer I witness a bad thing happen to a coworker with mental health issues get swept under the rug... :(,Both,847
40,Yes,Don't know,No,No,Mega,No,Rarely,While not personally affected I do have immediate family with mental health illness and my employer has been very supportive. Thanks for doing this survey.,Both,850
33,No,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,No,,The company I work for was started by engineers and so anything other then the engineering department has always lacked a bit. Now that we've grown things are better but I feel that overall our total benefits package (including healthcare) isn't well communicated. This reflects negatively on the mental health questions above but would also reflect negatively on any other sort of survey about the benefits. That is I don't think the company is purposefully doing less for mental health. They just aren't doing enough across the board and that includes mental health.,Both,859
39,No,Very difficult,Maybe,Maybe,Small,Yes,,Thank you for all you are doing to study this topic and raise awareness in our communities. ,Unclassified,868
30,Don't know,Very difficult,Yes,No,Small,Yes,Sometimes,The main reason for the openness answers are because of an experience with my last employer. I felt I could trust my direct supervisor so I divulged information. It ended up spreading to more supervisors and eventually my coworkers. Supers highly suggested treatment but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue. I lost most of my desire to program due to the experience not to mention thousands of dollars I lost - lost work time vacation time they used for treatment time doctors expenses etc. I have major depressive disorder high anxiety and mild agoraphobia. After seeing what treatment has to offer I will likely not seek it again and continue as is. (Long story short.),Anxiety,876
37,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,Yes,Never,(yes but the situation was unusual and involved a change in leadership at a very high level in the organization as well as an extended leave of absence),Unclassified,883
39,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,Maybe,Mega,No,Sometimes,I would add that while there were negative consequences for coworkers with mental health they were given a HUGE amount of leeway.  I think the team at large tried their best to be kind but that's how the person suffered.  The company actually gave this person a lot of help.  Which was cool.  But the team still discriminated.,Both,890
40,Don't know,Don't know,Maybe,Maybe,Large,Yes,Often,Bipolar spectrum is tricky.,Both,895
50,No,Somewhat easy,No,No,Small,Yes,Never,A lot of these answers aren't really applicable since I'm self employed as a sole proprietor.,Unclassified,899
25,Yes,Don't know,Yes,Yes,Mega,No,Sometimes,While I have not seen any direct retaliation against people with known mental illness many people do freely use insults commonly associated with mental illness (r****d for example) and criticize people behind their back for taking extra leave for doctor appointments (Oh I bet they are just hung over or other comments about how lazy they are.),Unclassified,908
43,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,No,Large,No,Sometimes,My employer gives access to basic counseling and referrals but I don't know (and it's not obvious) what might be covered in the way of expenses for therapy medication etc.,Depression,927

49,Yes,Don't know,No,No,Mega,No,Never,Thank you for shining a light on this topic.,Unclassified,974
38,Yes,Very easy,No,No,Large,Yes,Sometimes,While mental health is a part of our insurance program the UCR is 50% of 140% of medicare which means a solo mental health practitioner who will charge in my area $150-$180 a session will only result in a $45-$60 reimbursement and thus a very high out of pocket expense. This usage of a different schedule for UCR and often the lower rate is very hard to determine before purchasing insurance even in the new health insurance exchanges.,Both,1007
25,Don't know,Somewhat easy,Yes,No,Medium,Yes,Rarely,My work is using my brain. I do it incredibly well.I make an effort to avoid diagnosis of anything mental health related because I am convinced it would only affect me negatively.,Both,1020
37,Don't know,Somewhat easy,Maybe,No,Medium,Yes,Sometimes,My employer is extremely easy to work with and e.g. I have enormous leeway with flex time so I could take care of myself under that umbrella but I don't know and don't have a history of bring up mental health at the workplace so I am cautious in that area.,Both,1025
26,Yes,Don't know,No,No,Mega,No,Sometimes,I should note one of the places my employer fails with regards to mental health is that the company-paid health insurance policy does not cover trans healthcare needs.,Both,1051
39,No,Don't know,Maybe,Maybe,Small,Yes,Sometimes,I've never heard of a workplace that would actually allow you to call off for mental health reasons. So many places require a doctor's note for calling off sick. It's all set up to make you feel worse if you can't just suck it up. Thanks for working to change this!!!,Both,1071
43,Yes,Don't know,Maybe,Maybe,Small,Yes,Sometimes,This survey was tough as a self-employed individual. You may wish to discard responses from self employed people for much of your analysis.,Unclassified,1077
27,Yes,Very difficult,Maybe,No,Mega,No,Often,I answered based on previous job at large technical company where I was pushed out of my role within 3 months of disclosing diagnosis.I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.,Anxiety,1078
37,Yes,Don't know,Yes,Maybe,Medium,Yes,Sometimes,If a man in tech is afraid of speaking up about these things it is even worse for women in tech who are already fearful of and fighting against the stigma of incompetence.  On the other hand if a female in tech does not commiserate with her male coworkers on mental health problems she will no longer be seen as a team player. It is really a catch-22 for women in STEM.,Both,1079
30,Yes,Somewhat difficult,Yes,No,Mega,No,Often,This issue for me is very real at the moment. I have missed several days of work recently because of a bad reaction to a depression/anxiety drug and I hate not being able to discuss it with my boss without worrying that I will be labeled a liability. ,Both,1083
40,Yes,Somewhat difficult,Maybe,No,Mega,No,Sometimes,Really manager dependent. I have had managers who work with my strengths and others who want my to work on my weaknesses which are directly tied to my mental issues. ,Unclassified,1098

25,Don't know,Very easy,No,No,Small,Yes,Sometimes,I was (wrongly) diagnosed clinically depressed at 12 then bipolar I at 15 and medicated for a decade until decided myself to go drug free. Since then I've never been happier. Insomnia and my insatiablility for learning and programming have always had a symbiotic  relationship.It might also bear mentioning that I'm self-employed in addition to my more traditional day job.,Both,1114
